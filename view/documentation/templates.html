        <p>
          Most sites have at least one template, with a design including headers, footers, navigation etc.  This is where we start.  In your generated Silk site under 'template' there is a default template prepared for you called 'default.html'.  As indicated by its extension and mime-type this template is for html views.
        </p>

        <p>
          Do whatever you like in here as long as it is valid xhtml *and* contains a div tag with id 'silk-template'.
        </p>

        <p>
          The content of your individual views will be written into this div tag by our template mix in tool.
        </p>

        <p>
				  Note, if you don't want templates, you don't have to use them, just build your views in a little more detail :-)
